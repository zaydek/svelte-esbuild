unsolved problems

- cache folder
- build folder
- html template
- server-side hydration
- client-side bundle
- whitespace (prettier)
- esbuild + svelte
- esbuild plugin architecture (use esbuild / js as the main process, requires esbuild as a dev dependency if we do this)
- serve command
- watch command - we basically know how to do this in theory and since svelte is a compiler, error messaging should be
  even easier

* layout components -- need to figure out how dom diffing works in svelte
* markdown?
* dynamic routes (should be able to support with an explicitly named export / caching async responses)
* page props (should be able to support with an explicitly named export / caching async responses)
* router (to start we donâ€™t need to have page linking but the user is still paying for unused bytes)
