<!-- TODO: Right now we donâ€™t have a <Router> because every route is responsible
for conditionally rendering its slot based on pathStore. Another architecture
would be to use a <Router> where every <Route> is registered using
<script context="module">. The advantage of this apporach is that that only the
router needs to think whereas <Route> is otherwise idempotent. The disadvantage
of this approach is that we need a <Router> component which is slightly
annoying. -->
